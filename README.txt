Bioinfo Information:


1. File List : All must be in the same directory
- Bioinfo.java
- Sequence.java
- Node.java
- SLList.java
- List.java


2. In order to run this code, you must navigate to the directory where all the files MUST be located, compile the java programs and then input:

"java Bioinfo numberOfSequences fileName"

Where your numberOfSequences is an integer of the number of sequences you want to generate and the fileName is the name of the text file with the commands you wish to insert into this program are located.


3. I decided to put all of my methods in my Sequence class, except for print, which just get called from the Bioinfo class, because it seemed like a waste of typing to put it into the Sequence class.


4. I had a difficult time on the translate method, but eventually figured out how to not access null pointers, even though the code is extremely messy, it works and I attempted to mess with it to make it cleaner, but it kept giving me NullPointers, so I left it how it was.

I also had issues with the overlap method, but wikipedia has a webpage devoted to this "overlap problem" and that helped out a ton.
